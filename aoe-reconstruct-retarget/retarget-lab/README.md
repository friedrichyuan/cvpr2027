# AoE Retarget Lab

AoE Retarget Lab converts Open-AoE egocentric video into reconstructed
hand-object motion and robot-retargeting review assets. The supported fresh
path is:

```text
AoE RGB/annotation
  -> SAM3 target segmentation and tracking
  -> SAM3D Objects + object 6DoF
  -> EgoInfinity hand/object reconstruction
  -> Do-as-I-Do and/or SPIDER retargeting
  -> RGB overlay, pure-mesh HOI, plain robot video, triptych
```

Third-party backends, weights, datasets, caches, and generated experiments are
not vendored. Backend source trees remain upstream-owned; this repository
provides input conversion, orchestration, provenance checks, and review tools.
The clean checkout therefore has no `third_party/` directory. From the
Open-AoE repository root, create machine-local source checkouts with:

```bash
bash aoe-reconstruct-retarget/retarget-lab/scripts/maintenance/setup_third_party.sh
```

This helper fetches source code only; it is not a complete environment
installer and network transfers may require retry.
