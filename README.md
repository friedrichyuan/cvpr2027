EgoWhale takes in egocentric manipulation video and writes out dual-arm robot demonstrations: retargeted actions, a person-free scene, a depth-composited robot, and a quality report. Stages are independent, skip work that is already on disk, and are shaped so a later launcher can run them as Ray actors across a large corpus.

## Pipeline

| Stage | What it does | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retarget | Camera-frame parallel gripper, then smooth | `action/gripper.npz` |
| Segment | Person mask (SAM 3) | `visual/masks.npz` |
| Inpaint | Remove the person (ProPainter) | `visual/inpaint.mp4` |
| Depth | Scene depth (Depth Anything 3), scaled to meters | `visual/depth.npz` |
| Base + IK | Base pose and arm trajectory (cuRobo) | `action/base.json`, `action/ik.npz` |
| Approach | TrajOpt from the zero configuration to the first end-effector pose | `action/prefix.npz` |
| Composite | MuJoCo render; gripper hidden where the scene is closer | `visual/composite.mp4` |
| Curate | Frame checks, action statistics, then a VLM audit | `action/quality.json` |

A finished stage is skipped when every file in its output column exists. Delete those files to rerun it. Each stage is one class with `needs`, `makes`, and a GPU hint.

## Quick start

An episode is an EgoDex HDF5 file with a sibling `.mp4`. Python 3.12 is required. Rendering uses MuJoCo EGL, which the entry point sets before MuJoCo is imported.

```bash
python -m egowhale path/to/episode.hdf5 [out_dir]
```

When `out_dir` is omitted, files are written to `outputs/<parent>/<stem>/`.

Model weights stay local:

| Model | Path |
| --- | --- |
| SAM 3 | `thirdparty/sam3` |
| ProPainter | `thirdparty/propainter` |
| Depth Anything 3 (DA3-GIANT) | `thirdparty/da3` |

## Run one stage

```bash
scripts/<stage>.sh path/to/episode.hdf5 [out_dir]
```

| Script | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/retarget.sh` | episode | `action/gripper.npz` |
| `scripts/segment.sh` | sibling `.mp4` | `visual/masks.npz` |
| `scripts/inpaint.sh` | masks | `visual/inpaint.mp4` |
| `scripts/depth.sh` | inpaint | `visual/depth.npz` |
| `scripts/base_ik.sh` | gripper | `action/base.json`, `action/ik.npz` |
| `scripts/approach.sh` | IK | `action/prefix.npz` |
| `scripts/composite.sh` | gripper, inpaint, depth, masks, base, IK, approach | `visual/composite.mp4` |
| `scripts/curate.sh` | gripper, base, IK, approach, composite | `action/quality.json` |

Upstream stages are not rerun. A missing input raises `FileNotFoundError`.

## Configuration

The VLM audit in Curate calls Qwen3.5 when a key is present. Without one, that audit is skipped and the episode is not failed for it.

| Variable | Role | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EGOWHALE_VLM_API_KEY` | Bearer token. Unset skips the audit. | |
| `EGOWHALE_VLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint | DashScope compatible API |
| `EGOWHALE_VLM_MODEL` | Model name | `qwen3.5-plus` |
